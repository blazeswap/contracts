BlazeSwap is decentralized exchange to swap cryptocurrencies on the Flare networks (Flare/Songbird/Coston).

Highly inspired by Uniswap V2, it adds full support for FTSO provider delegation and FTSO/F-Asset rewards, generated by the liquidity locked in the pair contracts.

In-depth documentation on Uniswap V2 is available at [uniswap.org](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works).

The built contract artifacts can be browsed via [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/browse/@blazeswap/contracts@latest/).
